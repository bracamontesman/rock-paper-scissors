# rock, paper, scissors

this is my solution for the first project in the odin project roadmap. the challenge was to create a rock, paper, scissors game that plays five rounds. the machine generates a random selection and compares it to the user's input. after five rounds, the game ends and displays the scores along with the winner.

it currently has no ui, and all computations are performed in the web console.
